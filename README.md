# MERN-AUTH

This is basic implementation of User Authorisation And User Authentication with jwt in Mern application.
This repository guides you how to add signup , login and logout functionailty in your MERN web-App..

## Getting Started

To get started with the Make-Notes Webapp, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you've installed these dependencies, you can clone the repository and install the required packages:


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/make-notes-webapp.git
cd make-notes-webapp
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```


## host
The application should be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## What's Next
In the future, we plan to add a login feature to the Make-Notes Webapp. This will allow users to securely store and access their notes by requiring authentication before they can access the application.

We are currently working on implementing a backend API that can handle user authentication, and we plan to update the frontend of the application to include a login form that allows users to enter their credentials.

If you have any suggestions or feedback on how we can improve the Make-Notes Webapp, please don't hesitate to contact us or open an issue on our GitHub repository. We are always looking for ways to make our application better and more user-friendly.
